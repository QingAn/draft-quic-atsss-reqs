   Figure 1: Simplified Reference Architecture for ATSSS with Multipath
                                    TCP

   For ATSSS with Multipath TCP functionality, a client with at least
   two interfaces connected to two disjoint access networks (in this
   case, Access Net A and Access Net B), uses MPTCP to reach an MPTCP
   proxy over either, or both, of the access networks, which allows the
   client to communicate with a server which does not terminate MPTCP
   connections.

   Both the MPTCP Client and MPTCP proxy are configured with ATSSS rules
   from the network that govern how the multiple network paths between
   the MPTCP Client and MPTCP Proxy are used.  This relationship is
   shown using "." between the MPTCP Client and MPTCP Proxy.

4.  Carrying bytestreams over different access networks

5.  Carrying packets over different access networks

6.  Conclusion

   Based on the two above questions, it should be clear that MPQUIC
   could cover both cases.
