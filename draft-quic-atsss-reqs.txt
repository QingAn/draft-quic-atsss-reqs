1.  Introduction

   Mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets include
   different network interfaces that attach to different networks.  Over
   the years, various techniques have been proposed to support such
   multi-homed devices [RFC5533],[RFC6275],[RFC5213],[RFC6824].  For 5G
   networks, 3GPP is developing new solutions to ease the coexistence of
   different access networks.

   Users of these devices have different expectations concerning the
   utilization of their different network interfaces.  For simplicity,
   we consider a smartphone that is equipped with a Wi-Fi interface and
   a cellular interface, but the discussion below can be generalized to
   any network interface that supports IP.

   Some users of these smartphones expect seamless handovers.  For
   example, when they move out of the reach of their home Wi-Fi, they
   expect that the established flows (i.e.  TCP connections, UDP flows,
   ...) will continue over the cellular interface without any
   interruption.  As the Wi-Fi and the cellular networks use different
   IP addresses, this seamless handover requires some specific support

   from the network.  The current utilization of Multipath TCP on Apple
   smartphones is an example of this use case [IETFJ16].

   Some users of these smartphones want to load balance their flows over
   the different networks, e.g. by sending a delay sensitive flow over
   cellular and a long download over the Wi-Fi network.  Several
   smartphones enable applications to indicate their preferences when
   using network interfaces.  This steering can be managed by the
   smartphone, but flows need to continue after a handover.

   Other smartphones users may want to combine the cellular and the Wi-
   Fi network to improve the performance of individual flows.  The
   GigaLTE service deployed using Multipath TCP in South Korea in an
   example of this use case [IETFJ16].

   To support these different use cases in 5G networks, 3GPP is working
   on the Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSSS)
   service.  In this document, we abstract many of the technical details
   of future 5G networks to explain the requirements of the ATSSS
   service on IETF protocols.

   This document is organized as follows.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This document makes use of 3GPP specific terms defined in [RFC6459],
   mainly the following ones:

   o  Packet Data Network (PDN): is a packet-based network that either
      belongs to the operator or is an external network such as the
      Internet or a corporate intranet.  The user eventually accesses
      services in one or more PDNs.  The operator's packet core networks
      are separated from packet data networks either by User Plane
      Functions (UPFs).

   o  UE (User Equipment): refers to the devices that are hosts with the
      ability to obtain Internet connectivity via a 3GPP network.

   o  Access Point Name (APN): is a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
      and resolves to a set of gateways in an operator's network.  Data

      Network Name (DNN) is the APN equivalent in 5GS.  DNN is used for
      the selection of the UPF(s) for a PDU Session.

   o  User Plane: refers to data traffic and the required sessions for
      the data traffic.  In practice, IP is the only data traffic
      protocol used in the user plane.

4.  High level Overview

   The 5G Core (5GC) supports a service that provides exchange of data
   between an User Equipment (UE) and a data network (referred to as
   Packet Data Network (PDN)) identified by a Data Network Name (DNN).
   Such connectivity service, called PDU Connectivity Service, is
   supported via 'PDU Sessions' that are established upon request from
   the UE.  The type of PDU Session can be IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, Ethernet
   or Unstructured.

   It is out of the scope of this document to provide a comprehensive
   overview of 5G System (5GS) architecture.  In particular, this
   document does not describe how PDU Sessions are established, and thus
   how IP addresses/prefixes are assigned to requesting User Equipment
   (UEs).

   An UE can be provided a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service.  That
   is, an UE can exchange data with a PDN by using a "3GPP access
   network" and a "non-3GPP access network".  Such service relies upon
   the ATSSS feature.

4.1.  Reference Architecture

   To understand the operation of the ATSSS service, it is useful to
   consider the reference environment shown in Figure 1.  An UE is
   attached to two different access networks (Net A and Net B).  One of
   these access networks is managed by a 5G provider according to the
   3GPP specifications.  The second network is potentially managed by a
   different organization.  It is important to note that in this case,
   there is an IPSec tunnel between the UE and one device in the 5G
   network (not shown in Figure 1).  The UE interacts with a distant
   server through a Proxy function which supports ATSSS and is part of
   the 5G network.  The Proxy function enables the UE to use a transport
   protocol that supports the different access networks even if the
   server does not support it.  The UE and the Proxy exchange, using the
   5G control plane, rules that specify which flows are eligible to the
   ATSSS service.

   A simplified reference architecture is shown in Figure 1.

           Figure 1: Simplified Reference Architecture for ATSSS

   3GPP defined the following procedures [TS23501] that are applicable
   between "3GPP access" and "non-3GPP access" networks:

   o  Access Traffic Steering: selection of an access network for a new
      data flow and the transfer of the traffic of that data flow over
      the selected access network.

   o  Access Traffic Switching: migration of all packets of an ongoing
      data flow from one access network to another access network while
      ensuring session continuity.

   o  Access Traffic Splitting: split of the packets of a data flow
      across multiple access networks.

   Techniques to provide ATSSS are classified by the 3GPP into two
   flavors: (1) high-layer techniques which operate above the IP layer
   (e.g., MPTCP), and (2) low-layer techniques which operate below the
   IP layer.  Only high-layer steering techniques are discussed in this
   document.

   The traffic that matches an ATSSS rule can be distributed among
   available access networks following one of these modes:





Boucadair, et al.       Expires November 16, 2020               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 QUIC ATSSS                       May 2020


   o  "Active-Standby": The traffic associated with the matching flow
      will be forwarded via a specific access (called, active access)
      and switched to another access (called, standby access) when the
      active access is unavailable.

   o  "Smallest Delay": The traffic associated with the matching flow
      will be forwarded via the access that presents the smallest Round-
      Trip Time (RTT).  To that aim, specific measurements are conducted
      by the UE and a dedicated function co-located with the Proxy.

   o  "Load-Balancing": The traffic associated with the matching flow
      will be distributed among available access networks following a
      distribution ratio (e.g., 30% via a first access, 70% via a second
      access).

   o  "Priority-based": For this mode, accesses are assigned priority
      levels that indicate which access to be used first.  Concretely,
      the traffic associated with the matching flow will be steered on
      the access with a high priority till congestion is detected, then
      the overflow will be forwarded over a low priority access.

   We first describe version 1 of the ATSSS specification that uses
   Multipath TCP [RFC6824] and the 0-RTT convert protocol
   [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters].  We then discuss the requirements for
   version 2 of the ATSSS specification.

5.  ATSSS version 1

   For ATSSS with Multipath TCP functionality, a client with at least
   two interfaces connected to two disjoint access networks (in this
   case, Access Net A and Access Net B), uses MPTCP to reach an MPTCP
   proxy over either, or both, of the access networks.  This allows the
   client to communicate with a server which does not terminate MPTCP
   connections.

   Both the MPTCP Client and MPTCP proxy are configured with ATSSS rules
   from the network that govern how the multiple network paths between
   the MPTCP Client and MPTCP Proxy are used.  This relationship is
   shown using "." between the MPTCP Client and MPTCP Proxy.

   An ATSSS-capable UE can make use of the MPTCP functionality by
   establishing MPTCP-assisted connections via the MPTCP proxy relying
   upon the Convert Protocol [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters].  The UE behaves
   as a "Client", while the MPTCP proxy behaves as a Transport Converter
   [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters].

   The ATSSS-capable UE sends packets bound to connections matching an
   ATSSS rule to the provisioned Transport Converter and destination
   port number.  Concretely, the UE initiates the MPTCP connection
   towards the Transport Converter and indicates the IP address and port
   number of the Server within the connection establishment packet
   (i.e., in the payload of the SYN sent to the Transport Converter).
   Doing so enables the Transport Converter to immediately initiate a
   connection towards that Server, without experiencing an extra delay.
   The Transport Converter waits until the receipt of the confirmation
   that the Server agrees to establish the connection before confirming
   it to the Client.

   A flow example of an MPTCP-proxied connection is show in Figure 3.
   This example assumes that the Server is not MPTCP-aware.  The
   instructions included in the matching ATSSS rule will be followed for
   the management of the MPTCP connection (including the selection of
   the access network to establish the first subflow).

   This approach provides 0-RTT (Zero Round-Trip Time) conversion
   service since no extra delay is induced by the Convert protocol
   compared to connections that are not proxied.  Also, the Convert
   Protocol does not require any encapsulation (no tunnels, whatsoever).

5.1.  Sections to remove ?

5.1.1.  Discovery of the MPTCP Proxy

   During the attachment of an ATSSS-capable UE to the network, the UE
   retrieves the MPTCP proxy information: an IP address, a port number,
   and the type of the MPTCP proxy.  In the current release, the
   mandatory MPTCP proxy type is the "Transport Converter"
   [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters].

   The UE is also provided with a set of steering policies that will be
   used by the UE to decide how flows will be distributed among
   available access networks.  More details are provided in "ATSSS
   Steering Modes" Section.

5.1.2.  Multipath-Specific Addressing

   An ATSSS-capable UE is assigned two additional IP addresses/prefixes,
   called "link-specific multipath" addresses/prefixes; each associated
   with an access network.  These addresses are only used by the MPTCP
   functionality of the UE to manage subflows that are established with
   the assistance of the MPTCP proxy.

   Link-specific multipath addresses/prefixes may not be globally
   reachable IP addresses/prefixes [RFC8190].

Internet-Draft                 QUIC ATSSS                       May 2020


   Note, "Link-specific multipath" addresses/prefixes are not link-local
   addresses/prefixes (i.e., 169.254.0.0/16 [RFC8690] or fe80::/10
   [RFC4291]).

6.  ATSSS version 2

   The MPTCP-based ATSSS discussed in the previous section is specific
   to TCP, obviously.  In particular, it does not provide a similar
   feature for UDP flows that would require such service.  A UDP flow
   can be defined as series of UDP packets that have the same source and
   destination address and port numbers.

   ATSSS version 2 aims at providing the same service as ATSSS version
   1, i.e.  splitting, switching and steering, to non-TCP flows.  Such
   flows include generic UDP flows, QUIC connections, DTLS or IPSec
   flows between the UE and a remote host. 3GPP discussed several
   proposals to carry non-TCP traffic, including using TCP as proposed
   earlier in [I-D.boucadair-mptcp-plain-mode], using multipath
   extensions to DCCP [I-D.amend-tsvwg-multipath-dccp].  The work within
   3GPP now focuses on using Multipath extensions to QUIC
   [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath].

   It appears that Multipath QUIC brings several benefits to support the
   ATSSS service.  First, Multipath QUIC is a multipath transport
   protocol which is capable of splitting data over different access
   networks as Multipath TCP.  Measurements and simulations show that
   Multipath QUIC provides similar performance as Multipath TCP when
   carrying bytestreams over different access networks [MPQUIC-Conext].
   Second, Multipath QUIC can be combined with the Unreliable Datagram
   Extension [I-D.ietf-quic-datagram] that provides the capability to
   transport unreliable messages such as UDP datagrams or IP packets
   inside a QUIC session.  Third,the MASQUE BOF is currently discussing
   different solutions to provide proxy services over a QUIC connection
   [I-D.schinazi-masque-protocol],[I-D.schinazi-masque-connect-udp],
   [I-D.piraux-quic-tunnel],[I-D.piraux-quic-tunnel-tcp].

   Some ATSSS modes can be natively supported by the base QUIC
   specification.  For example, the "Active-Standby" and "Smallest
   Delay" steering modes can be supported directly between an UE and a
   QUIC server without any assistance from the network other than the
   performance measurement information.

   Nevertheless, blindly distributing packets among existing paths may
   lead to complications such as: - Aggressive use of user quota if one
   of the access networks is subject to volume-based quota.  - The
   steering policy as currently defined in ATSSS is local to the UE and
   the proxy.  There are no means to signal that policy to an upstream

   server.  - Frequent connection migration if both access networks are
   used to forward data; each with a distinct source IP address.

6.1.  Paragraph to remove ?

   Some proposals were made in the past to encapsulate UDP in MPTCP (by
   means of header swapping and extraction of the UDP payload).  For
   example, early versions of specified how UDP flows, in particular,
   can be distributed among available paths by leveraging MPTCP
   capabilities.  It does so by including a "Protocol" TLV in the MPTCP
   payload; doing so allows an MPTCP Proxy to unambiguously identify UDP
   packets vs. native TCP connections.  Some modifications are also
   required at the MPTCP Proxy to avoid HOL blocking issues of UDP-
   encapsulated data.  This design approach is sub-optimal if the UDP-
   encapsulated data carry its own congestion control signals (that are
   not visible to the MPTCP proxy because these signals are encrypted
   such as in QUIC).

8.  Conclusion

   Based on the two above questions, it should be clear that MPQUIC
   could cover both cases.
